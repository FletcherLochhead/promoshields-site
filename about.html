    <h2 class="section-title">Our Story</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>PromoShields Ltd was founded by <strong>Fletcher Lochhead</strong> and <strong>George Watson</strong> — two young innovators with a bold mission: to create a safer nightlife culture by protecting drinks from spiking while simultaneously giving brands a positive way to advertise.</p>

      <p>The idea for PromoShields started in 2023, when Fletcher began working on early-stage prototypes as part of the <strong>Young Enterprise Scheme</strong>. With a drive to tackle the widespread problem of drink spiking, he explored countless materials and methods to make drink safety simple, fast, and effective. Later, George joined the mission, bringing critical insight, creativity, and energy into turning the concept into a fully-fledged business.</p>

      <p>Fast forward to today, PromoShields is distributing drink covers to bars and venues across New Zealand. We’ve worked closely with <strong>local communities, events, schools, and hospitality venues</strong> to make our mission a reality. We also participated in <strong>Momentum</strong> — a business mentorship and development programme — to refine our strategy and scale our impact.</p>

      <p>Our model is simple and powerful. <strong>Businesses sponsor the shields with branded messages and logos</strong>, giving them a chance to make a meaningful social impact while gaining brand visibility. In return, <strong>bars receive the covers for free</strong>, and their <strong>customers get protected</strong>. It’s a win-win-win for safety, business, and the public.</p>

      <p>Our vision is to see PromoShields in every bar, festival, and social event where drink safety matters. We believe in combining <strong>innovation, entrepreneurship, and social responsibility</strong> — and we’re just getting started.</p>
