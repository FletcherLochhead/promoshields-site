    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      PromoShields exists to make nightlife safer and more enjoyable. We provide eco-friendly, single-use drink covers that protect against drink spiking—empowering people to enjoy themselves without fear.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      The idea for PromoShields started with a simple question: “How can we prevent drink spiking without ruining the vibe of a night out?” Founded by a young Kiwi entrepreneur, PromoShields combines safety and style in a way that makes a real difference. What began as a local safety initiative has grown into a movement.
    </p>

    <h2>Why We Care</h2>
    <p>
      Drink spiking is a global issue that affects thousands of people every year. We're passionate about providing a practical solution that clubs, festivals, and individuals can trust. Every PromoShield used is a step toward a safer world.
